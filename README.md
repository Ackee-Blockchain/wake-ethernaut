## 🧑‍🚀 What is Ethernaut?

The Ethernaut is a Web3/Solidity based wargame inspired by [overthewire.org](https://overthewire.org/wargames/), played in the Ethereum Virtual Machine. Each level is a smart contract that needs to be 'hacked'.

The original source of this game can be found on [ethernaut.openzeppelin.com](https://ethernaut.openzeppelin.com) website.
