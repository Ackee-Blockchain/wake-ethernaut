Congratulations! You have completed the tutorial. 
Have a look at the Solidity code for the contract you just interacted with below.

You are now ready to complete all the levels of the game, and as of now, you're on your own.

Godspeed!!

Contract's code: contracts/lv00_hello.sol
- HINT: You can try (ctrl + click) on the file path. That should open the file in your editor (if your IDE supports it - VS Code does :).
