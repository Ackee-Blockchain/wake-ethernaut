# Printing level assignments and done messages

## Level assignment

Level assignment tells you what is the goal of that level - in other words, what you need to do to solve that level.

To print a level assignment, pass a **number** to `level.py`. Example: To print the assignment of level 0 do:

```bash
python level.py 0
```

## Level done message

After you solve the level, you are allowed to print the done message, which:
- shows you some additional context about the level or
- gives you some suggestions as to what to see next or
- anything else, ex. motivation to continue  :)

To print the done message, pass a **number** and **"done"** to `level.py`. Example: To print the done message of level 0 do:

```bash
python level.py 0 done
```
